  description: This weapon was created on the basis of the special sniper rifle VSS "Vintorez" as a silent weapon for special forces. It allows the shooter to effectively fire at an enemy protected by a bulletproof vest, without revealing his position. One of the main features is the use of an integrated silencer and 9 Ã— 39 mm cartridges with a heavy bullet.
