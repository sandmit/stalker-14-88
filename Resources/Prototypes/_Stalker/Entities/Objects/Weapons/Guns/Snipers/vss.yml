  description: «Special Sniper Rifle» is designed for silent and flameless sniper shooting during special operations when it is necessary to keep the shooter's position secret. Its ammunition provides high armor-piercing and stopping effects; in addition, this weapon is equipped with an integrated silencer and optics. Despite the small-capacity magazine, it is highly valued by stalkers.
